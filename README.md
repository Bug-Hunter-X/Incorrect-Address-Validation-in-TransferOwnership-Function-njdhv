# Incorrect Address Validation in TransferOwnership Function

This repository demonstrates a common bug in DApps: incorrect address validation.  The `transferOwnership` function fails to properly validate the provided `newOwner` address, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

## Bug Description

The original code only checks if the `newOwner` address is the zero address ('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'). This is insufficient.  A valid address could still be malformed or represent an unintended recipient.

## Solution

The solution utilizes a proper address validation library or function to ensure the `newOwner` address is valid before updating ownership.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the buggy code and try to transfer ownership to an invalid address, e.g., a string or an address with an incorrect format.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior or error.
4. Run the corrected code and compare the results.
